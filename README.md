 Split train and test data in 70:30 ratio using ‘Stratified split’ and save test data
separately. Use the split train data for building the model.
 Extract features that are relevant for classification
 Identify the target variable.
 Do all the necessary pre-processing steps like One-hot encoding, Treating
missing values, Standardization, converting categorical to numerical data, etc.
wherever necessary.
 Handle any class imbalance, if required.
 Split the data into 80:20 for train and validation.
 Apply different classifiers and check validation accuracy.
 Calculate the cross-validation score, precision, recall and also display the
confusion matrix.
 Evaluate the accuracy on test set.
